excerpt: Learn how to configure DatoCMS to use your existing AWS/Google Storage buckets to store your digital assets
---

DatoCMS uses the domain `www.datocms-assets.com` to serve your project's asset files through Imgix, and uses an AWS S3 bucket we own to store the actual files. 

If you're interested, on [higher plans](/pricing/) you can instruct DatoCMS to use your existing AWS/Google Storage buckets to store your digital assets.

### Supported Storage Providers

You can integrate DatoCMS with any AWS S3-compatible cloud storage service:

* [AWS S3](/docs/guides/custom-assets-domain/aws-s3)
* [Google Cloud Storage](/docs/guides/custom-assets-domain/google-cloud-storage)
* Digital Ocean
