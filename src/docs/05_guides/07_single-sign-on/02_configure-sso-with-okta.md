The following provisioning features are supported:

* **Push New Users** - Creating a new user in Okta and assigning them to the DatoCMS application will create a new user in DatoCMS.
* **Push Profile Updates** - Updates to a user in Okta will be pushed to DatoCMS.
* **Push User Deactivation** - Deactivating the user or disabling the user's access to DatoCMS within OKTA will deactivate the user in DatoCMS.
* **Import New Users** - Users created in DatoCMS can be pulled into Okta and turned into new AppUser objects for matching against existing Okta users.
* **Push Groups** - Groups created in Okta can be pushed to DatoCMS. Attributes pushed include name and group members.
* **Pull Groups** - Groups created in DatoCMS can be pulled into Okta for reference within Okta.
* **Delete Groups** - Groups deleted or removed from the DatoCMS application within Okta will be deleted within DatoCMS.
