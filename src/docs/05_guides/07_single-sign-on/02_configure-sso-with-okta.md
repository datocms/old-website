### Importing existing DatoCMS users in Okta

If you want to import existing users into Okta, enter the Provisioned users section in DatoCMS settings, and from there press the **Sync with regular users** button.

![Third step](../../images/okta/9-1-export-datocms-users.png)

This will convert every DatoCMS collaborator into an SSO User:

![Third step](../../images/okta/9-2-export-datocms-users.png)

Now under the DatoCMS app in Okta, find the **Import** tab, and click **Import Now**.

![Third step](../../images/okta/9-3-import-users.png)

A list of DatoCMS users and possible associations with Okta users will be populated below. Click **Confirm Assignments** and these users will now be tracked, updated, and de-provisioned by Okta.

Now head over to the **Provisioning > To App** section of Okta, and under **Attribute Mappings** press the **Force Sync** button:

![Third step](../../images/okta/9-4-force-sync.png)

If the integration is working correctly, you should see the imported users with the status **Synced**:

![Third step](../../images/okta/9-5-force-sync.png)

### Provisioning Okta users to DatoCMS

There are various ways to add new users to DatoCMS within Okta. The quickest way to assign multiple users at once is to navigate to the **Assignments** tab of the Application, and press the **Assign > Assign to people button**:

![Third step](../../images/okta/10-3-add-user.png)

From there, you will be able to assign users with the **Assign** button:

![Third step](../../images/okta/10-4-add-user.png)

As soon as you add new users to the DatoCMS application, they will be visible in the **Provisioned users** section in DatoCMS.

### Managing provisioned user roles

#### Pushing groups

That these are the only Group attributes that are updatable via the Okta integration:

* Group name
* Group members

Groups created in DatoCMS and imported into Okta cannot be deleted or changed in Okta. They must be managed in DatoCMS.

Since groups imported from DatoCMS into Okta are not editable within Okta, it is suggested to create groups in Okta first and then push those groups to DatoCMS via the **Push Groups** button in Okta.

Create a group with the same name in Okta. For example, if a "Blog Contributor" role exists in DatoCMS, create a "Blog Contributor" group in Okta.

Add members to the group in Okta.

![Third step](../../images/okta/11-create-group.png)

Open the newly created group, and press the **Manage Apps button**. In the modal, assign the group to the DatoCMS application:

![Third step](../../images/okta/12-assign-app-to-group.png)

Open the DatoCMS Application in Okta, open the **Push Groups** tab and click on the **Push Groups > Find groups by name** button:

![Third step](../../images/okta/13-1-push-group.png)

Enter the first characters of the group name inside the text input, select the group from the dropdown and press **Save**:

![Third step](../../images/okta/13-2-push-group.png)

### Gotchas and Troubleshooting Tips

TODO

* DatoCMS application supports Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning. The SAML assertion will create an SSO user on the fly the first time they try to log in from the identity provider.
* SAML Single Logout is currently not supported.
* Users without **First Name** or/and **Last Name** in their DatoCMS profiles will be imported to Okta as "Unknown Unknown".
* Since groups imported from DatoCMS into Okta are not editable within Okta, it is suggested to create groups in Okta first and then push those groups to DatoCMS via the **Push Groups** button in Okta.
