On the modal, select **SAML 2.0** and press **Create**:

![SAML](../../images/okta/6-1-new-app.png)

A new screen will appear. Give the new app a name and press **Next**:

![SAML](../../images/okta/6-2-new-app.png)

Fill in the following fields:

* **Single sign on URL**: Copy the **Assertion Consumer Service URL** field from DatoCMS and paste it here;
* **Audience URL (SP Entity ID)**: Copy the **DatoCMS Metadata URL** field from DatoCMS and paste it here;
* **Name ID format**: `EmailAddress`;
* **Application username**: `Email`;

![SAML](../../images/okta/7-1-configure-saml.png)

In the **Attributes Statements** section add the following:

* `FirstName`: `user.firstName`
* `LastName`: `user.lastName`

![SAML](../../images/okta/7-4-configure-saml.png)

Leave the other fields unchanged and press **Next**. Finish the creation of the application compiling the last wizard step and press **Finish**:

![SAML](../../images/okta/7-2-configure-saml.png)

In the **Sign On** tab, copy the URL of the **Identity Provider metadata**...

![SAML](../../images/okta/7-3-configure-saml.png)

...and paste it into the DatoCMS **Identity Provider SAML Metadata URL** field:

![SAML](../../images/okta/7-6-configure-saml.png)

Make sure to also specify the default role editors will be assigned (learn more about this field in the [Mapping Okta groups to DatoCMS roles](/docs/guides/single-sign-on/configure-sso-with-okta#mapping-okta-groups-to-datocms-roles) chapter):

![SAML](../../images/okta/7-5-configure-saml.png)

Press the **Save settings** button.

#### SCIM App

Switch your Okta dashboard to **Admin mode** by clicking the button in the upper right corner:

![Switch to admin](../../images/okta/1-admin-mode.png)

A new screen will appear. Give the new app a name and press **Next**:

![First step](../../images/okta/4-1-create-step.png)

In the next **Sign-On Options** screen select **SAML 2.0** as the Sign-On method (no Relay state is required), set **Application username format** to **Email** and press **Done**:

![Second step](../../images/okta/4-2-create-step.png)

Now enter the **Provisioning** tab and click the **Configure API Integration** button:

![First step](../../images/okta/5-1-provisioning.png)

Fill in the following fields:

* **SCIM 2.0 Base URL**: Copy the **SCIM Base URL** field from DatoCMS and paste it here;

### Importing existing DatoCMS users in Okta

If you want to import existing users into Okta, enter the Provisioned users section in DatoCMS settings, and from there press the **Sync with regular users** button.

![Third step](../../images/okta/9-1-export-datocms-users.png)

This will convert every DatoCMS collaborator into an SSO User:

![Third step](../../images/okta/9-2-export-datocms-users.png)

Now under the DatoCMS app in Okta, find the **Import** tab, and click **Import Now**.

![Third step](../../images/okta/9-3-import-users.png)

A list of DatoCMS users and possible associations with Okta users will be populated below. Click **Confirm Assignments** and these users will now be tracked, updated, and de-provisioned by Okta.

Now head over to the **Provisioning > To App** section of Okta, and under **Attribute Mappings** press the **Force Sync** button:

![Third step](../../images/okta/9-4-force-sync.png)

If the integration is working correctly, you should see the imported users with the status **Synced**:

![Third step](../../images/okta/9-5-force-sync.png)

### Provisioning Okta users to DatoCMS

There are various ways to add new users to DatoCMS within Okta. The quickest way to assign multiple users at once is to navigate to the **Assignments** tab of the Application, and press the **Assign > Assign to people button**:

![Third step](../../images/okta/10-3-add-user.png)

From there, you will be able to assign users with the **Assign** button:

![Third step](../../images/okta/10-4-add-user.png)

As soon as you add new users to the DatoCMS application, they will be visible in the **Provisioned users** section in DatoCMS.

### Managing provisioned user roles

Okta has the concept of [Groups](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Directory/Directory_Groups.htm). With Groups, Okta administrators can create different sets of users based on common themes, giving them different permissions.

You can leverage this feature to assign different DatoCMS roles to provisioned users.

#### Pushing groups

Create a group in Okta for each role available in your DatoCMS project. For example, if a "Blog Contributor" role exists in DatoCMS, create a "Blog Contributor" group in Okta.

Add members to the group in Okta.

![Third step](../../images/okta/11-create-group.png)

Open the newly created group, and press the **Manage Apps button**. In the modal, assign the group to the DatoCMS application:

![Third step](../../images/okta/12-assign-app-to-group.png)

Open the DatoCMS Application in Okta, open the **Push Groups** tab and click on the **Push Groups > Find groups by name** button:

![Third step](../../images/okta/13-1-push-group.png)

Enter the first characters of the group name inside the text input, select the group from the dropdown and press **Save**:

![Third step](../../images/okta/13-2-push-group.png)

If everything worked correctly, you should now see the same group under the **Groups** section in DatoCMS:

![Third step](../../images/okta/13-3-push-group.png)

#### Mapping Okta groups to DatoCMS roles

In the **Groups** section in DatoCMS, you can now assign a specific role to each Group.

For each group, assign the role with the same name:

![Third step](../../images/okta/14-1-groups-to-roles.png)

Once you've configured a role for every group, the following rules will apply:

* The group's role will be applied to to every user belonging to it;
* In case a user belongs to multiple groups, the first group in the list will be the one to win. You reorder groups with drag&drop to customize their priorities;

In case a user does not belong to any group, the default role specified in the **SSO Settings** will be used:

![SAML](../../images/okta/7-5-configure-saml.png)

### Gotchas and Troubleshooting Tips

* While it's technically possible to import DatoCMS Groups into Okta, it's not advisable to do so, as groups created in DatoCMS and imported into Okta cannot be deleted or changed in Okta. They must be managed in DatoCMS. It is suggested to create groups in Okta first and then push those groups to DatoCMS via the **Push Groups** button in Okta as described in the [Pushing groups](/docs/guides/single-sign-on/configure-sso-with-okta#pushing-groups) chapter.
* DatoCMS application supports Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning. The SAML assertion will create an SSO user on the fly the first time they try to log in from the identity provider.
* SAML Single Logout is currently not supported.
* Users without **First Name** or/and **Last Name** in their DatoCMS profiles will be imported to Okta as "Unknown Unknown".
* Since groups imported from DatoCMS into Okta are not editable within Okta, it is suggested to create groups in Okta first and then push those groups to DatoCMS via the **Push Groups** button in Okta.
