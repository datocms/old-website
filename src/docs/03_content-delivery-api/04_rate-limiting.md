title: Rate limiting

API Rate limits specify the number of requests a client in a specific time frame.

Since this API is meant to be used for delivering content from DatoCMS to apps, websites and other media consumed by end-users, **no rate-limiting policies are enforced**.

#### Reaching your plan monthly API calls limit

For projects under a paid plan, even exceeding the API calls or bandwidth limit does not lead to the interruption of the service, but the payment of an additional fee commensurate with the use. For pojects under a free plan, service will be temporarily disabled until the beginning of the following calendar month, unless you provide a credit card.
