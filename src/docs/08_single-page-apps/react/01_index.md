title: Integrate DatoCMS with React
---

Building a single-page application using React and GraphQL is probably one of the fastest way to go live with a CMS-backed website.

With the globally-distributed CDN serving the Content Delivery API of DatoCMS **you can serve directly content to your end users without an intermediate server**. You just maintain and host a static frontend application and we deal with the rest!

To fetch GraphQL content with React from DatoCMS there are many options. We have explored and prepared a few demos for you so that you can pick your preferred flavour or start building a new one using our examples.
