title: A blog with various GraphQL flavours

With the following demos we'll set up a simplistic recipe's blog:

You can [see it live here](https://demo-datocms-react-graphql.netlify.com/). The UI is exactly the same for all the projects linked here. The only difference is in how the data is fetched from the GraphQL API.

### react-datocms

All the following examples are using [our React components](https://github.com/datocms/react-datocms) to manage responsive images. With this component we can take full advantage of our optimized GraphQL API, that is returning all the information you need **to provide an exceptional support to progressive, responsive images**.

A deep and detailed writeup of what we offer in [this blog post](https://www.datocms.com/blog/offer-responsive-progressive-lqip-images-in-2020).

### React & GraphQL Request example

[GraphQL Request](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request) is a minimal GraphQL client that we've used to build probably the simplest [example project](https://github.com/datocms/react-graphql-demo) of this set. 

Set up the demo by clicking on the following button:

  <img src="https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy/button.svg" title="Deploy with DatoCMS" />
</a>

### React & Apollo example

If you use [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com) to manage your data layer you can check this demo out. There's a section in the example's README that is specific to this technology that you might want to read. Here's the [project code](https://github.com/datocms/react-apollo-demo).

Set up the demo by clicking on the following button:

<a class= "DocPage__img-link" href="https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy?repo=datocms/react-apollo-demo">
  <img src="https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy/button.svg" title="Deploy with DatoCMS" />
</a>

### React & URQL example

Finally, we used [URQL](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql) to build the same example using this approach. [Find the repo here](https://github.com/datocms/react-urql-demo).

Set up the demo by clicking on the following button:

<a class= "DocPage__img-link" href="https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy?repo=datocms/react-urql-demo">
