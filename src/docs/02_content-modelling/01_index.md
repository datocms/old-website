title: Content modelling

DatoCMS can be seen as a editor-friendly interface over a database, so the first step is to build the actual schema upon which users will generate the actual website content.

The way you define the kind of content you can edit inside each different administrative area passes through the concept of <strong>models</strong>, which are much like database tables.

Each administrative area can specify a number of different models, and they represent <em>blueprints</em> upon which users will store the website content. For example, a site can define different models for articles, products, categories, and so on.

You can create new models in the *Admin area > Models* section of your administrative area:

![foo](../images/data-model/1.png)

Each model consists of a set of <strong>fields</strong> that you define.

Go ahead in the next section to check all the different field types and available options.
